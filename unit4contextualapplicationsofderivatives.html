                    <h3 class="text-content">To be specific, the derivative (often notated as \(\frac{dy}{dx}\)) denotes the value produced when an infinitesimally small change in y is divided by an infinitesimally small change in x. </h3>
                    <h3 class="text-content">Through this notation, we can think of derivatives as the rate of change over a very very small interval.</h3>
                    <h3 class="text-content">On the other hand, the notation \(f'(x)\) can be thought of as the derivative without thinking of it as a slope (rate of change).</h3>

                    <h3 class="text-content">Suppose \(x(t)\) is a function that gives you the position of a particle with respect to time.
                        <br>Then the derivative of \(x(t)\) with respect to time is the velocity (or (\v(t)\)).
                        <br>Then the second derivative of \(x(t)\) with respect to time is the acceleration (or \(v(t)\)).

                    <h3 class="text-content">Position: \(x(t)\)
                        <br>Velocity: \(v(t) = x'(t)\) or \(\frac{dx}{dt}\)
                        <br>Acceleration = \(a(t) = v'(t)\) or \(\frac{dv}{dt} = x''(t)\) or \(\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\)
                    </h3>
                    <h3 class="text-content">Example: The position of a car at time t is given by the equation \(x(t) = t^4 - t^3 + 19\). Find the position, velocity and acceleration at t = 2 seconds.</h3>
                    <h3 class="text-content">\(x(t) = t^4 - t^3 + 19\)
                        <br>\(v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = 4t^3 - 3t^2\)
                        <br>\(a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = 12t^2 - 6t\)

                    <h3 class="text-content">At t = 2 seconds,</h3>
                    <h5 class="pre-req">Can \(x\) be negative? Yes, it can!!! This is because x is the position of the particle in some space, not the distance. 
                        <br>If it were distance, then it cannot be negative.</h5>
                    <h3 class="text-content">\(x(2) = 2^4 - 2^3 + 19 = 27\)
                        <h5 class="pre-req">Note: <br>\(v(2)\) can also be denoted as \(\frac{dx}{dt}|_{t=2}\)</h5>
                        <br>\(v(2) = 4(2)^3 - 3(2)^2 = 20\)
                        <br>\(a(2) = 12(2)^2 - 6(2) = 36\)
                    </h3>
                    <h3 class="text-content">So, What does this mean?</h3>
                    <h3 class="text-content">Since x is positive, we can assume that, relative to some object, the car is in the supposed positive direction (we get to choose what we define as positive direction).
                        <br>Since velocity AND position are positive, the car will continue to travel in the positive direction at t = 2 seconds.
                        <br>Since both velocity AND acceleration are positive, the car is speeding up at t = 2 seconds.
                    </h3>
                    <h3 class="text-content">Try it yourself:
                        <br>The position of a bee is given by the function \(x(t) = \sin(2t)\). Find the velocity and acceleration of the bee at t = 5 seconds. Is the bee speeding up or slowing down?</h3>

                    <h3 class="text-content">Example: At a given moment t, a family of bacteria has a population of \(B = 17t - 3^t\). After how many hours will the basteria stop reproducing?</h3>
                    <h3 class="text-content">\(B = 17t - 3^t\)
                        <br>\(\frac{dB}{dt} = 17 - (\ln(3))3^t\)
                    </h3>
                    <h3 class="text-content">When \(\frac{dB}{dt} = 0\), the family of bacterias will stop reproducing.</h3>
                    <h5 class="pre-req">Note: <br>Always show three decimal places on you final answer!! Round you answer ONLY on the final step!!</h5>
                    <h3 class="text-content">\(0 = 17 - 3^t\ln(3)\)

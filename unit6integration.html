               <h1> The Area Under The Curve</h1>
                    <p><strong>pretty interesting stuff here, could make that title into a horror movie&#128128;</strong></p>
                    <p>Integration is a method to add a bunch of small parts to find the whole. It is also called the antiderivative. An integral undoes the derivative.</p>
                    <h2>There are two types of integrals:</h2>
                    <p>-Definite integrals (Gives us change within two bounds) in terms of derivatives, it gives us the particular solution to the integral:</p>
                <img src="Screenshot_20240712_143844_Samsung Notes.jpg" alt="definite integral">
                <p>-Indefinite Integrals (Integral without bounds) this one gives us the general solution:</p>
                <img src="" alt="indefinite integral">
                <h2>Riemann Sums</h2>
                <p>When taking the definite integral, we are basially finding the area under the graph between the output of the function and the x-axis. Functinons are often graphed in shapes that we dpont have area formulas for. This is where the Riemann sum method comes in. This method splits the area up into rectangles (a shape we DO know the area formula for!!)</p>
                <break>As you can see as we increase the amount of rectangles in our graph the closer our rectangles represent the original shape, and the better our estimate is. </break>
                <h2>There are two types of rimann sums</h2>
                <p>-Left hand Riemann sums </p>
                <break>In left hand Riemann sums we take the left most point in our chosen interval</break>
                <p>-Right hand Riemann sums</p>
                <break>We take the right most point in our chosen interval</break>
                <h2>Estimates</h2>
                <p>Our estimate can vary from being an over or an underestimate based on the shape of the graph. Generally, if we are using a left sum and the graph is increasing then it is an underestimate and if the graph is decreasing then it is an over estimate. If using a right sum and graph is increasing it is an overestimate and if graph is decreasing its an underestimate. Don't waste braincells memorizing these... It is pretty easy to tell by looking at the graph and or just visualizing it. </p>
                <p>So how do you take Riemann sums? Well since they are just a bunch of rectangles all you do is take each individual rectangle's area and then add them all up! I sure hope you know what the area formula for a rectangle is. Its base*height. The interval chosen/given in the question is your base and the height is the output of your function. (This will come in handy when you are looking at only tables or input/outputs and have no graphs at hand to visualize.)</p>

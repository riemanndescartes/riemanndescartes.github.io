                <h1>Applications of Integrals</h1>
                <p>This unit is all about the different uses of integrals. It's also very example heavy; to get better, you have try to do as many different types of questions in this unit as possible, so you are aware and ready for all the different types of questions that could come on the test.</p>
                <h2>We can use integrals to find areas between two curves</h2>
                <p>suppose we have this graph</p>
                <img alt="area between curves graph">
                <p>well we know that an integral of a function gives us the area between the curve and the x-axis. To find the area between two curves we would just need to take the integrals of the two curves and then subtract getting us the middle region!</p>
                <p>so for this we would need the integral of the two functions from the left most point they intersect at to the right most point. This might be obvious on some graphs but others we would have to graph them in the graphing calculator to find the exact points of intersection. Solving for the difference of both the integrals would give us the area we are trying to find.</p>
                <p>in the above graph (find graph and complete example)</p>
                
                <h2>Average Value Functions</h2>
                <img alt="average value formula">
                <p>Average means summing up everything then dividing by the number of terms.</p>
